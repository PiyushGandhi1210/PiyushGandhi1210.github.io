**Extinguishing the Blaze: Impact of Crop Residue Management on Stubble Burning in India**    
  
**Abstract**: Crop residue burning is a major environmental concern in India, exposing millions to hazardous air pollution. A key driver is the narrow planting window between rice harvesting and wheat sowing, compounded by limited knowledge of sustainable residue management. In a randomized controlled trial with rice farmers in India, I evaluate the impact of subsidizing early-maturity rice seeds—giving farmers more time to manage residues—and providing technical training on sustainable disposal methods. Preliminary results suggest that seed subsidies reduce burning by 27 percentage points, and combining subsidies with training reduces burning by 33 percentage points. A back-of-the-envelope calculation using ITT estimates and the social cost of carbon in India suggests that a $3 per acre seed subsidy reduces CO₂ emissions worth $44 per acre.
