<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Piyush Gandhi, a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at UC Santa Cruz, focusing on the intersection of development and environmental sustainability in developing countries. </p>

<p>My job market paper evaluates how subsidies and training can reduce crop residue burning in agriculture â€” a major source of emissions in India. I hold an MPhil in Economics from the University of Oxford and have led large-scale randomized controlled trials on labor and environmental issues. I'm passionate about using research to help design inclusive, climate-resilient development strategies around the world. </p>

 <p>Feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:pigandhi@ucsc.edu">pigandhi@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
